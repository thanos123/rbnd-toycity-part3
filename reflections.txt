How long did you spend working on this project?
about 3 hours

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
my 1st new feature which involved returning products. I had to think about misc things, eg removing stock and transactions from the customer

What two additional features did you build? Why?
my 1st new feature is returning products and the 2nd a couple more methods for looking for transactions.
Both would be useful and time-saving for whoever is using the system which would result to better customer service.

Where do you still have room to grow?
- working on more complex scenarios and remembering to include all necessary adjustments!
- organising errors / exceptions
